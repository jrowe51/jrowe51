## Get to know James Rowe

<!--
My name is James Rowe and I am a Data Science and Analytics Master's student. I work a lot with R, Python, and SAS to get descriptive and inferential statistics from large datasets.

I also like to work with Webscraping in Python. My projects aim at making information/opportunities more readily available by automating the search process in the browser.

I am always looking for help with back-end development in Python.
